# How to run examples

You will need `cargo`, `wasm2luau` and `rojo` installed.

- In a terminal, `cd` into the folder of the example you want to run
- Enter `lune run build-this-example`
- Open the `build.rbxl` that was set up inside `target-luau`.
- In Roblox Studio, choose 'Run' (you do not need to 'Play' the file)
